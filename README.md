# Whirledit

### version 2.0 out now!!!

 WhirlEdit has got the geatest update ever!
 This is just great!
 
 It has only one syntax highlight.. that's just python..
 
looks like no one wants to help me in this project.. (please prove me wrong)

```

v2:
> complete rewrite
> python syntax
> tabs
> scrollbar fix
